## Primary Storage

Primary storage is the computer’s short-term memory.
It holds the data and programs the CPU is using right now so that everything runs fast.

### Example1:

When you open Google Chrome, its tabs and windows stay in RAM so the CPU can use them quickly.

### Example2:

When gaming, the map, characters, and textures load into RAM for smooth performance.

### Question

What is the advantage of keeping data in short-term memory instead of going back to storage each time?

## RAM

- RAM is temporary memory.
- It forgets everything when you turn the computer off.
- It holds what you are using right now.

## ROM

- ROM is permanent memory.
- It keeps important startup instructions that never change.

### Question

Why does one need to forget everything when powered off, while the other must never forget?

## Virtual Machine

If RAM becomes full, the computer uses part of the storage drive as pretend RAM.
This is slower but stops the system from crashing.

### Analogy

Your desk is full of books, so you start placing extra books on the floor.
It works, but it slows you down.

### Example

Opening too many Chrome tabs makes the system use virtual memory.

## Cache

- Cache is a tiny, super fast memory inside the CPU.
- It stores the most commonly used instructions and data.

### Analogy

A chef keeps the most used spices right beside the stove instead of across the kitchen.

### Example1

Scrolling Instagram feels fast because your phone’s CPU reuses cached instructions constantly.

### Example2
Web browsers cache small tasks to reduce delays when switching between tabs.

## Secondary Storage

Secondary storage holds files permanently. It does not get wiped when power goes off.

### Analogy

Your bookshelf keeps all your books safe even when you are not studying.

### Example1

Saving a Word document to a hard drive.

### Example2

Storing photos on your phone.
