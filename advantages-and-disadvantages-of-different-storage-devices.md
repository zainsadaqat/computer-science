# Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Storage Devices

Storage devices usually differ based on six ideas:

## Capacity
How much data they can hold. 

## Speed
How fast they can read or write data.

## Portability
How easy they are to carry around.

## Durability
How well they survive drops, heat, dust or damage.

## Reliability
How likely they are to work without losing data.

## Cost
How expensive they are per gigabyte.

## Real world analogy
Think of storage devices like different types of bags for carrying things.

- A suitcase has high capacity.
- A backpack is easier to carry.
- A metal box is durable.
- A cloth bag is cheap but not very protective.
- A safe is reliable but heavy and expensive.
- A lightweight pouch is fast to open but holds little.

Devices are similar. Each one trades something for something else.

### Common device types
Hard Disk Drive
Large capacity, cheap, slower because it uses spinning parts.

### Solid State Drive
Fast, reliable, durable because it has no moving parts, but more expensive per gigabyte.

### USB Flash Drive
Portable, easy to plug in, medium capacity, sometimes slower, cheap.

### Optical Disc
Cheap and portable, but low capacity, slow and easy to scratch.

### Cloud Storage
Very high capacity, accessible anywhere with internet, but depends on network speed and has ongoing cost.

### Example 1
A photographer uses an SSD in her laptop. She needs very fast speed when editing large pictures. She also uses external hard drives because they are cheaper and let her store many older projects even though they are slower.

### Example 2
A school gives students USB drives. They are cheap, portable and good enough for homework files. The school does not give SSDs because that would be too expensive for simple tasks.

### Check questions
#### Question 1
Why might someone choose a hard disk instead of an SSD?

#### Question 2
Which device would be worst for constant dropping and rough handling and why?
