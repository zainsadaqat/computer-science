# Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a small computer built inside another device to control it. It only does one main job and does it reliably.

## Analogy
A vending machine computer. It is not a full laptop. It only knows how to accept payment, check stock, and drop snacks.

## Characteristics
- Designed to do one job
- Very reliable
- Usually low power
- Often real time (must react quickly)
- Found inside everyday products

## Example-1
A microwave oven has an embedded system that controls the timer, heat level, and spinning plate.

## Example-2
A washing machine has an embedded system that controls water level, motor speed, and timing.

## Question
Why do embedded systems not need to be as powerful as a laptop?
