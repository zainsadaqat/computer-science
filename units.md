# Units

## Bit
A bit is the smallest piece of data. It can be either 0 or 1.

## Nibble
A nibble is 4 bits. It is just a small grouping that makes reading binary easier.

## Byte
A byte is 8 bits. Most computers treat a byte as the basic chunk used to store a single character like the letter A.

## Kilobyte
A kilobyte is one thousand bytes.

## Megabyte
A megabyte is one thousand kilobytes.

## Gigabyte
A gigabyte is one thousand megabytes.

## Terabyte
A terabyte is one thousand gigabytes.

## Petabyte
A petabyte is one thousand terabytes.

### Real world analogy
Think of data units like containers of water.

One bit is a tiny droplet.

A byte is like a spoon of water.

A kilobyte is like a small cup.

A megabyte is a bottle.

A gigabyte is a big water jug.

A terabyte is a full water tank.

A petabyte is like several water tanks lined up.

The idea is simple. You group small containers into bigger containers so it becomes easier to count large amounts.

### How data needs to be converted into binary format?

Computers do not understand letters or pictures directly. They only understand electricity turning on or off. On is 1 and off is 0. Everything must be translated to these two states.

Letters get converted to numbers.

Numbers get converted to binary.

Pictures turn into millions of tiny color values which also become binary.

Sound becomes rapid measurements which also become binary.

This is the only language the machine can physically process.

### Real world example 1
When you type the letter A on a keyboard the computer does not store A. It looks up a number for A (for example 65 in ASCII). The number 65 becomes the binary 01000001. That binary is what the machine actually uses.

### Real world example 2
Take a digital photo. The photo contains millions of pixels. Each pixel has a red value a green value and a blue value. Each of those values is stored as bytes. Those bytes are all binary underneath. That is why pictures take more space than text: far more bytes are needed.

## Data capacity and calculation

If one image is 3 MB and you want to store 200 of them:
Total needed space = 3 MB multiplied by 200
That equals 600 MB.

If a video is 1.5 GB and you have 10 of them:
You need 15 GB.

### Question
If one song is 5 MB and you have 300 songs how much storage do they require?
