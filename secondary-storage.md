# Secondary Storage

## The need for secondary storage

A computer loses everything in RAM when the power turns off. RAM is like a desk where you do active work. 
You need a place to keep things safe when you are done, and you want to reuse them later. 
That long term place is secondary storage.

Secondary storage holds your files, photos, apps and the operating system even when the device is off.

## Why it is needed?
- It keeps data permanently.
- It has much more space than RAM.
- It lets you reuse data again and again.
- It allows sharing and transferring data.

## Magnetic storage
Examples: Hard disk drive, magnetic tape.
How it works: Data is stored using magnetised patterns on a spinning disk or tape.
Strengths: Very large capacity, low cost per gigabyte.
Weaknesses: Slower, moving parts can break if dropped.

## Solid state storage
Examples: SSD, USB stick, SD card.
How it works: Stores data in tiny electronic cells. No moving parts.
Strengths: Fast, durable, quiet, low power.
Weaknesses: Higher cost per gigabyte.

### Example 1
A graphic designer edits huge files and needs very fast speed.
Suitable choice: Solid state drive inside the computer.
Reason: Fast read and write speeds make work smooth.

### Example 2
A school needs to store many years of archive documents cheaply.
Suitable choice: Magnetic hard drives or magnetic tape.
Reason: Large capacity at low cost.

### Example 3
A movie studio wants to distribute a short film physically but cheaply.
Suitable choice: DVD.
Reason: Low cost and easy to hand out even though the capacity is low.

### Example 4
A student needs a light way to carry homework between school and home.
Suitable choice: USB flash drive.
Reason: Portable, simple, cheap.

### Question 1
Why is secondary storage needed even if a computer already has RAM?

### Question 2
Which storage type is best for rough handling and why?

### Question 3
What type of storage would a library use to keep backups for many years at low cost?
